Abstract
--------

GnomeShell HotCorners allows to change the hot corners position or hide them.

The HotCorners feature is disabled by default. If you want this feature to come
back, change the value of the UPDATE_HOT_CORNERS constant in extension.js

See http://www.guadalinex.org/

Installation
------------

 * Copy the extension directory under ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
 * Restart the shell: ALT + F2, type "r" and press ENTER.
 * You are ready to go.
